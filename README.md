# Egal | Ø¹Ù‚Ø§Ù„

**Wear your identity â€” digitally.**

Egal is a premium, AI-powered platform for generating personalized digital identities in authentic, professional Saudi attire. It combines cultural depth with a sleek, modern interface that meets global standards of simplicity, security, and trust.

This project is built with React, TypeScript, and Google's Gemini API.

## âœ¨ Features

- **AI-Powered Portraits**: Upload a photo and receive multiple, ultra-realistic portraits in authentic Saudi thobes, shemaghs, and bishts.
- **Bilingual Interface**: Seamlessly switch between English and Arabic with full RTL support.
- **Production-Ready**: Built with best practices for security, privacy, and performance.
- **Minimalist UX**: A clean, intuitive, and responsive interface inspired by modern design principles.
- **Privacy First**: User photos are processed once for generation and are never stored on a server.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- A modern web browser
- A Google Gemini API Key

### Environment Variables

Before running the application, you need to configure your environment variables. The application expects a `process.env.API_KEY` to be available in its environment.

When deploying to platforms like Vercel, configure this in the project's environment variable settings.

**Example Configuration (`.env.example`)**:

```
# Your Google Gemini API Key
API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

### Installation & Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/egal.git
    cd egal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses ES modules imported via an `importmap`, so no `npm install` is required for the specified packages. Ensure you have a local server to serve the files correctly. The Live Server extension in VS Code is a good option.

3.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The AI Studio environment automatically injects the API key. For local development outside of that environment, you would need a way to provide `process.env.API_KEY` to your frontend code, typically through a build tool like Vite or Create React App.

4.  **Run the application:**
    Serve the `index.html` file using a local web server.

##  deployment

This application is a static single-page application and can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

### Deploying to Vercel

1.  **Push your code** to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  **Import your project** into Vercel. Vercel will auto-detect that it is a static site.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - Go to your project's **Settings > Environment Variables**.
    - Add a new variable:
      - **Name**: `API_KEY`
      - **Value**: `your_gemini_api_key_here`
4.  **Deploy**. Your site will be live at the provided Vercel domain.
