# Egal | Ø¹Ù‚Ø§Ù„

**Wear your identity â€” digitally.**

Egal is a premium, AI-powered platform for generating personalized digital identities in authentic, professional Saudi attire. It combines cultural depth with a sleek, modern interface that meets global standards of simplicity, security, and trust.

This project is built with React, TypeScript, and Google's Gemini API.

## âœ¨ Features

- **AI-Powered Portraits**: Upload a photo and receive multiple, ultra-realistic portraits in authentic Saudi thobes, shemaghs, and bishts.
- **Bilingual Interface**: Seamlessly switch between English and Arabic with full RTL support.
- **Production-Ready**: Built with best practices for security, privacy, and performance.
- **Minimalist UX**: A clean, intuitive, and responsive interface inspired by modern design principles.
- **Privacy First**: User photos are processed once for generation and are never stored on a server.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Just want to see the app?

If you only need to open the project and click around, follow these plain-language steps:

1. **Install the tools:** Open the built-in terminal and run `npm install`. This happens once and prepares the project.
2. **Start the ready-made preview:** Type `npm run preview:local` and press Enter. The command builds the app and keeps it running.
3. **Open the live page:** In Codex, click the **Ports** icon on the left, find port **4173**, and choose **Open in Browser** (or **Open in Preview**). A new tab with the site appears.
4. **Test the features:** You can switch pages, change the language, and upload the sample photo that ships with the project at `public/demo/sample-headshot.svg`â€”no extra setup needed. Image generation requires your own Gemini API key, so expect an error message until you add one.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- A modern web browser
- A Google Gemini API Key

### Environment Variables

Before running the application you must provide a Google Gemini API key. The Vite build reads a `GEMINI_API_KEY` variable from your environment and exposes it to the frontend as `process.env.API_KEY`.

When deploying to platforms like Vercel, configure this in the project's environment variable settings.

**Example `.env` configuration**:

```
# Your Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

### Installation & Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/egal.git
    cd egal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the app in development mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Vite will print the local development URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:5173). You can start interacting with the UI immediately. If you have your own Gemini credentials available, export them before running the command:
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
    ```
    Without a key you can still click around the interface, but AI generation requests will fail until a valid credential is supplied.

4.  **Set up your API Key for full functionality:**
    Create an `.env` file (or use your shell environment) with `GEMINI_API_KEY`. This unlocks authenticated Gemini requests so that generation features work end-to-end.

### Previewing the production build

To preview the optimized build the same way it will run in production:

```bash
npm run preview:local
```

The script automatically builds the project before starting `vite preview`, so you will never
hit the blank/404 page that appeared previously when the `dist/` folder hadn't been generated.
Once the command is running you can open the production preview at
**http://127.0.0.1:4173/**.

#### Opening the preview in Codex

If clicking the URL gives you a blank tab, manually attach your browser to the
forwarded port:

1. Run `npm run preview:local` (or `npm run dev` for the development server).
2. In the left toolbar, click **Ports** and wait for port `4173` (or `5173` in
   dev mode) to appear.
3. Hover the port entry, choose **Open in Browser** (or **Open in Preview**),
   and a new tab will load the running app.
4. Interact with the UI normallyâ€”navigation, uploads, and language toggles all
   behave exactly as they do in a regular browser window.

> **Tip:** If clicking the URL inside this environment opens a blank tab, open your IDE's **Ports** panel, locate port `4173`, and choose **Open in Browser** (or **Preview** in Codex) to attach to the running server.

### Quick testing checklist

Use these commands to cover the most common testing flows:

| Goal | Command | What to look for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fast UI smoke test | `npm run dev` | Confirm the page renders at http://127.0.0.1:5173 and the main navigation works. |
| Production build preview | `npm run preview:local` | Visit http://127.0.0.1:4173 to ensure the optimized bundle loads without console errors. |
| End-to-end Gemini checks | `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"` then rerun either workflow | Verify AI-powered features respond successfully with your own API quota. |

### Functional testing walkthrough

Follow this path to interact with the full experience and verify that navigation and uploads behave as expected:

1. Start the preview server with `npm run preview:local` (or the dev server with `npm run dev`).
2. In Codex or any browser-based IDE, open the **Ports** sidebar, select the forwarded port (`4173` for preview or `5173` for dev), and choose **Open in Browser/Preview** so the UI renders in a new tab.
3. On the landing screen, click **Upload Photo** and select the bundled sample headshot located at `public/demo/sample-headshot.svg` (the file is also reachable at `/demo/sample-headshot.svg` once the server is running).
4. Confirm that you can navigate between **Privacy Policy**, **Terms of Use**, and **Bank Details** using the footer links while the upload is processing.
5. For full AI generation, supply your own `GEMINI_API_KEY`; without it you can still explore navigation, validation, loading states, and error messages, but image generation will not complete.

## Deployment

This application is a static single-page application and can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

### Deploying to Vercel

1.  **Push your code** to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  **Import your project** into Vercel. Vercel will auto-detect that it is a static site.
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - Go to your project's **Settings > Environment Variables**.
    - Add a new variable:
      - **Name**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
      - **Value**: `your_gemini_api_key_here`
4.  **Deploy**. Your site will be live at the provided Vercel domain.
