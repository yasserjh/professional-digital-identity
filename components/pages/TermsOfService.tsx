            <p>
                Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Egal web application ("Service") operated by us.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
            <p>
                Our Service allows you to upload a photograph and generate new images based on it. You are responsible for the content you upload. You agree not to use the Service to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload any content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
                <li>Upload any content that infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any party.</li>
                <li>Upload images of individuals without their consent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                You retain all rights to the original photograph you upload. You grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and modify your photograph solely for the purpose of providing the image generation service to you. This license terminates immediately after the generated image is delivered to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You own the rights to the final, generated images you create using the Service, and you may use them for personal or commercial purposes, subject to the terms of our third-party service providers (Google).
            </p>

            <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>
                The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that the generated images will meet your expectations. The quality of the output depends heavily on the quality of the input image.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                In no event shall Egal, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Saudi Arabia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Changes</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page.
